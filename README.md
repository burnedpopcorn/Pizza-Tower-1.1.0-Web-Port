# Pizza Tower 1.1.0 Web Port

## If you have Issues after an Update
Go [HERE](https://burnedwebsite.vercel.app/guide/wipecache.html#wiping-site-cache) to Learn how to Wipe Site Cache, which should fix your problem.

If it doesn't fix your problem, please open an issue on Github or in my Discord Server

## Current state of the Project

As of 11/23/24, all major issues have been fixed

## Extra Features
- Level Select
    > Level Select Entrance is located in the Old Tower Secret Room (First Floor)
- Custom Commands
    > Currently there is only one, ```LEVELSELECT```, which brings you to the Level Select (EXPERIMENTAL and currently has issues, so I recommend the Intended Entrance instead)
- Custom Keybinds
    > ```TAB / F5``` opens the Console
    >
    > ```CTRL / F8``` activates command ```DEBUGHUD```, which displays a FPS counter and what seems to be a Memory Visualizer
    > 
    > ```ALT / F6``` activates command ```SWITCHCHAR```, which lets you switch characters immediately (Certain animations can delay or prevent this effect)
